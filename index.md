## About Me

I am a 4th year undergraduate student at UC Davis majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I currently work with [Prof. Iman Soltani](https://soltanilab.engineering.ucdavis.edu/people/iman-soltani) and [Prof. Stephen K. Robinson](https://hrvip.ucdavis.edu/people/stephen-robinson). 

My research interests are in contact-rich manipulation in unstructured environments. I'm interested in robotics, embodied AI, and computer vision. I want to make manipulators more capable, increasing their intelligence, perception, and affinity for contact.
